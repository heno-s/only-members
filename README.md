# Only members website (work in progress...)

### App goal:
To make responsive, data-driven, user based application, where only users can create posts, become an admin and become member. Users that are not signed in will only be able to see the posts, see someone elses profile, register and see all admins and all members. Users that are also members will have the opportunity to change their post title color and post message color from default (white) to whatever colors will be offered. They will be able to turn the colors on and off if they want. Admins will have the ability to delete whichever post they want. Users can also edit their post.
